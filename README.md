# XKCD Viewer
XKCD Viewer is a small Java application that reads comics from the xkcd site and displays them on screen.

To build this project:
1. run build.sh in the main project (you should only need to run this once)
2. run run.sh. This should start the program

The hope is that this will become an application that conveniently checks in the background and notifies the user when a new XKCD comic has been posted. Other features are in the works and further suggestions are always welcome.
