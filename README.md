# XKCD Viewer
XKCD Viewer is a small Java application that reads comics from the xkcd site and displays them on screen.

To build this project:

1. run build.sh in the main project (you should only need to run this once)
2. run run.sh. This should start the program

Features to add:

1. A background worker that checks if a new comic has been added every x minutes (x set by user). 
2. Add ability to use as a startup program.
3. Add ability to tell user how many comics they have missed since their last time on the program.
4. Other features are in the works and further suggestions are always welcome.
