# XKCD Viewer
XKCD Viewer is a small Java application that reads comics from the xkcd site and displays them on screen. The program gives you the ability to scroll through the comics in a small window. To navigate you can use the left arrow (or "a" key) to move to the previous comic, the right arrow (or "d" key) to move to the next comic, and the "r" key to get a random comic. The program has been updated with the ability to tell you, at startup, how many comics you have missed since your last time using the program.

#####To build this project:

1. run "build.sh" in the main project (you should only need to run this once).
2. run "run.sh" to start the program.

#####Features to be added:

1. A background worker that checks if a new comic has been added every x minutes (x set by user). 
2. The ability to use the program at startup.
