# XKCD Viewer
XKCD Viewer is a small Java application that reads comics from the xkcd site and displays them on screen. The program gives you the ability to scroll through the comics in a small window.  The program has been updated with the ability to tell you, at startup, the number of comics that the use has missed since their last time using the program.

#####Navigation:
* Use the left arrow (or "a" key) to move to the previous comic
* Use the right arrow (or "d" key) to move to the next comic
* Use the "r" key to move to a random comic
* Use the Escape key to exit the program.

#####To build this project:

1. run "build.sh" in the main project (you should only need to run this once).
2. run "run.sh" to start the program.

#####Features to be added:

1. A background worker that checks if a new comic has been added every x minutes (x set by user). 
2. The ability to use the program at startup.
